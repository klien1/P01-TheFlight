                You hold onto the seat the best you can to brace for the impact into the water.
                Then suddenly you feel the entire plane hit the water.
                You look out the window and the plane is slowly sinking into the water.
                You quickly open the emergency door before the plane completely submerges.
                You are the first one to go through the door and Emma follows closely behind.
                You jump out of the plane and try to stay afloat.
                Another passenger tries to leave through the emergency exit,
                but the plane explodes and pushes you and Emma away from the plane.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you come to your senses, Emma was nowhere to be found.
                The explosion illuminates the dark sky to show a small nearby island.
                You start swimming to the island. Once you reach the island you are completely exhausted
                and fall asleep on the shore.
            </p>
            <p>
                You wake up the next morning and begin to look around.
                You see that you are on an island.
                The sun is shining brightly and as you look around you see a forest.
                You turn around and look at the ocean and see a clear blue sea as if the plane never crashed.
                Then you look along the shore and you see a dark figure lying about half a mile away.
