                You ask the flight attendant for a glass of water. As the flight attendant hands you the glass of water,
                you look at the name tag and it says "Emma." You say thanks Emma and she smiles in return.

                You begin to feel sleepy, so you close the window and take a nap.
                You were sleeping for a few hours.
                Suddenly, you are awaken by a loud boom followed by a scream in the background.
                You look around and everyone is looking outside the window. You open your window and look outside.
            </p>

                As you open the window, you see the left wing of the airplane covered in flames.
                You see the lights in the plane flicker on and off.
                Eventually the lights turn off and the entire plane is pitch black.
                You feel the plane descending and you see the emergency door near you.
