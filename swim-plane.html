                You begin swimming towards what is left of the plane.
                You see burning debris all over the surface of the water.
                You scream, "Is anyone out there!?" and get no response.
                You continue to look around and you see a dark figure floating nearby.
                You swim towards it and notice that it's a person.
                As you get closer you see that person is wearing a flight attendant uniform.
                You reach the floating dark figure and find that it's Emma.
                You try to wake her up by shaking her shoulder, but you get no response. You check her pulse....no pulse;
                she was gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                You take a deep breathe to calm yourself.
                You realize panicking won't solve anything.
                You remember seeing a nearby island before you swam towards the plane.
