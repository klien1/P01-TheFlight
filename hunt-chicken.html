                You grab a nearby rock as a weapon and begin chasing the chicken.
                The chicken was very agile and maneuvered around you as you were swinging the rock.
                You tired yourself out and gave up hunting the chicken.
            </p>
            <p>
                You place the rock on the ground and see some cherries nearby.
                Your stomach was growling, so you rushed towards the cherries and starting eating some.
                As you were eating the cherries, you realized you were eating choke cherries.
                The choke cherries were poisoning your respiratory system and it was getting difficult for you to breathe.
                You suffocate and die.
