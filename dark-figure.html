                Your curiosity takes you to the dark figure. You start walking along the shore towards the figure.
                When you get closer, you begin to see the details of the dark figure.
                It's a person wearing a flight attendant uniform!
                You rush to the person.
                When you are next to the person, you notice that it's Emma.
                You check her pulse and it's still there; she's still alive.
                You perform CPR on her until she wakes up.
            </p>
            <p>
                She coughs up the remaining water in her body and slowly gets up.
                She asks, "Where am I?"
                You answer, "We're on an island."
                Everything begins to hit her and she starts tearing up.
                Once Emma calmed down, she asks, "What do we do now?"
