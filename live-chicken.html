                You let the chicken live because you believe the chicken will guide you towards some food.
                You follow the chicken and it avoided some cherries.
                In your head, you believe that the cherries must be poisonous since the chicken avoided it.
                You avoid the cherries and continue to follow the chicken.
                The chicken stops to peck at a banana on the ground.
                You look up and see a banana tree.
                You reach for some bananas and start eating them.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you were satisfied with the bananas, you leave the chicken alone and continue to explore the forest on your own.
                While exploring, you hear a helicopter flying nearby.
                You rush toward the sound of the helicopter.
                You reach the shore and you see the helicopter flying nearby.
                You quickly start spelling "SAVE ME" in the sand.
                The helicopter notices something written in the sand and flies toward your island.
            </p>
            <p>
                The helicopter lands on the island and you rush toward the helicopter.
                It was a rescue helicopter that was looking for the plane that crash.
                They luckily spotted you and took you home.
