                You open the emergency door and jump out of the plane.
                While you are falling, you look towards the plane and see the fire on the plane illuminating the sky with a red glow.
                You watch the plane crash into the ocean as you descend toward the ocean.
                A few moments later, you land in the ocean as well.

            <p>
                After you land in the water you swim up to the surface.
                You look around for the plane and see it about a half a mile away from you.
                The plane was engulfed in flames. Then suddenly the plane explodes.
                The explosion was so bright that it revealed a nearby island and the remnants of the plane.
