                You look around the shore to see if there is anything around.
                You notice a lot of rocks on the shore and have an idea.
                You begin collecting the rocks and putting them all in one pile.
                You slowly start spelling "HELP" with the rocks you gathered.
                After you were done writing the message with the rocks, you took a break and laid down by your message.
                After a while you dozed off.

                While you were sleeping, the summer sun continued to shine on your body.
                You wake up with a headache and start feeling dizzy.
                You were dehydrated and there was no drinkable water nearby.
                Then you slowly begin to lose consciousness and pass out.
                You die from a heat stroke.
