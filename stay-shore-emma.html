                You and Emma decide to stay at the shore and look around.
                You see some rocks and ask Emma to help you gather the rocks and place them in one pile.
                Then you and Emma start spelling "HELP" with the rocks you two gathered.
                After you two were done, you start to lay down by the message and take a nap.
                Emma wakes you up and says, "We need to find water and shade before we can rest."
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree with her and get up to look for some water in the forest.
                You two stumble upon a river and immediately start drinking the cool water flowing through the river.
                After you two were satisfied, you started walking back toward the "HELP" message.
                Once you arrived at the message, you two rested at the entrance of the forest where there was shade.
                You two were tired and started to lie down and take a nap.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some time, you hear a helicopter close to the island.
                When you and Emma woke up from the nap, you see a helicopter land next to the help sign.
                It was the rescue helicopter looking for survivors of the plane crash.
                You two were lucky the helicopter saw the message.
                The rescue helicopter took you and Emma back home.
