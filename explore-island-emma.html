                You and Emma decide to go into the forest to look for some food.
                After a few minutes of walking in the forest, you two stumble upon a bush of cherries.
                You were both very hungry, so you two start eating the cherries until you were both stuffed.
                After you two were satisfied, you hear Emma gasping for air.
                You were about to ask her what was wrong, but you start gasping for air as well.

                You two had consumed a poisonous plant called choke cherries.
                After a few minutes of trying to breathe, you and Emma collapse to the ground.
                You watch Emma struggling to breathe and eventually she stopped moving.
                You try to call Emma's name to see if she was still alive, but everything starts to get dark
                and you eyes become heavy. You closed your eyes and never opened them again.
