                You continue to look for survivors, but you don't find anyone.
                The only thing you hear are the flames from the plane.
                After all the swimming, the flames start to dwindle and the night sky becomes darker and darker.
                Exhaustion begins taking over your body.
                You try to look around for the nearby island, but the flames dispersed and it was pitch black.
                You cannot see a thing and try to remember where you saw the island.
                You try to swim toward the island and your body is too exhausted.
                You don't have enough strength left to move.
                You slowly sink into the dark ocean.
